        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Preperation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 320 degrees Fehrenheit</li>
        <li>Line an 8" springform cake tin with butter and parchment paper, using the base upside down</li>
        <li>Butter and line the sides of the pan as well</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cheesecake biscuit base</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Break up crackers roughly by hand and place in a food processor (alternately, place in a ziploc bag and crush using a rolling pin)</li>
        <li>Blitz until fine crumbs. Add butter, briefly blitz until dispersed and resembles wet sand</li>
        <li>Pour into prepared cake tin, using a spatula to roughly spread over the base and up the walls</li>
        <li>Using a measuring cup or glass cup, compact and flatten the crumbs into the base and sides</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a mixer or bearer to beat the cream cheese until smooth, no longer than 20 seconds on speed 4(beating too long can cause the cheesecake to crack while baking)</li>
        <li>Add flour, beat for 5 seconds on speed 4 until just incorporated</li>
        <li>Add vanilla, sour cream, sugar, and lemon zest. Beat until just combibned (10 seconds max, speed 5)</li>
        <li>Add eggs one at a time, beat in between until just combined (5 seconds each), after the last one, beat until the egg is fully incorporated</li>
        <li>Pour into prepared crust</li>
        <li>Bake for 55 minutes. The top should be a very light golden brown, not cracked, and flat. It should jiggle slightly when you shake the pan.</li>
        <li>Cool the cake in the oven with the door slightly open, then transfer the whole pan into the fridge for four hours</li>
        <li>Remove sides, use overhanging paper to slide the cheesecake off the cake pan, then slide the cheesecake off the paper</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Strawberry topping</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Placed chopped strawberries (1/4 lb), vanilla, sugar, and lemon juice in a sauce pan</li>
        <li>Simmer for 10 minutes, until strawberries breakdown</li>
        <li>Mix cornstarch with water, add into the saucepan and stir</li>
        <li>Add halved strawberries, cook 1 minute to soften</li>
        <li>Sauce should be syrupy - remove from stove and cool</li>
        <li>One cool, stir and adjust thickness with a small amount of water to get it to "oozing" consistency (be careful, don't add too much water at once!)</li>
        <li>Spoon onto cheesecake so it's covered in a single layer of strawberries, refrigerate another 2 hours</li>
        <li>Slice and serve with remaining sauce</li>
    </ol>
